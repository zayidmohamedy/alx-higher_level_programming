## higher-level programming - Python

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting.
